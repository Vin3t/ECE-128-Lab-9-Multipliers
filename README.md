# ECE-128-Lab-9-Multipliers
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement digital multiplier circuits using two different architectural approaches. For the first part of the lab, a sequential multiplier is developed which performs multiplication over multiple clock cycles using a shift and addition algorithm. The second part focuses on creating a combinational multiplier, which produces the product of two numbers within a single clock cycle using parallel logic. Together, these two multiplier designs allow for a direct comparison between sequential and combinational hardware strategies.
